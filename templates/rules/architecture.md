# Architecture

**Deep modules > shallow** (Ousterhout):
- Interface much simpler than implementation.
- Information hiding = goal. Hide complexity behind simple APIs.
- Red flags: pass-through methods, shallow modules leaking impl detail.

**Layer discipline** (Clean Architecture):
- Domain/core can't import from infrastructure/framework.
- Deps point inward toward core.
- Enforced by dependency-cruiser (TS), depguard (Go), crate boundaries (Rust).

**File size**: max 300 lines/file, max 50 lines/fn. Exceeded → split.

**Folder naming**: kebab-case.
