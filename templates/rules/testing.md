# Testing

**TDD** (Beck red/green/refactor):
1. Write failing test first.
2. Minimum code to pass.
3. Refactor for quality — tests keep you safe.

**Co-locate tests** with source (`foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts`).

**Property-based testing** for non-trivial logic — fast-check (TS), proptest (Rust), rapid (Go) generate edge cases automatically.

**No deletion to pass**: never delete or weaken test to pass. Fix code, not test.

**Mutation testing** measures test quality beyond coverage. Run periodically.

**Proof of work**: run test command, show passing output before "done". Never write "tests should pass" — run them, confirm.
